# Blue Bird

Simple push notification receiver app for both ios and android.


**Blue Bird is an open source mobile application that makes easier for developers to give "Push Notifications" to the app when needed.**


For examples
1. When my server's CPU utilization is over 90%.
2. When my server's Memory utilization is over 90%
3. When my customer bought product through web application.
4. Any Back-End Transactions.
5. etc..

Developers can make an simple API call with given tokens to send push notifications to the Blue Bird.

**Since this projects is using EXPO, there is no needs for Google's Firebase or any Cloud Messaging service.**

**Expo and Sysmetic Co. is handling & saving all the push notification datas for you**

All pull requests are welcomed!
